## Grades
- Engineering Grade: 100.0/100
- Quant Grade: 14.6/100

## Engineering Notes
- No major runtime reliability issues observed.

## Quant Notes
- Grade capped at 60 due to small sample (<10 closed trades).
- Non-positive expectancy observed.
- Profit factor below 1.0 indicates weak edge.

## Runtime Notes
- Forced cleanup closed 1 open position(s).

## Runtime Errors
- None

## Caveats
- This is testnet paper execution and does not include full live slippage/latency/psychology effects.
- Small sample windows can strongly overfit recent market regime.
- Projection assumes future trade distribution resembles observed sample.
