## Grades
- Engineering Grade: 100.0/100
- Quant Grade: 60.0/100

## Engineering Notes
- No major runtime reliability issues observed.

## Quant Notes
- Grade capped at 60 due to small sample (<10 closed trades).

## Runtime Notes
- Forced cleanup closed 2 open position(s).

## Runtime Errors
- None

## Caveats
- This is testnet paper execution and does not include full live slippage/latency/psychology effects.
- Small sample windows can strongly overfit recent market regime.
- Projection assumes future trade distribution resembles observed sample.
