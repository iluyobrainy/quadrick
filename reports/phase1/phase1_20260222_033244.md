## Grades
- Engineering Grade: 0.0/100
- Quant Grade: 30.0/100

## Engineering Notes
- Initialization failed.

## Quant Notes
- Grade capped at 60 due to small sample (<10 closed trades).
- Non-positive expectancy observed.
- Profit factor below 1.0 indicates weak edge.
- No realized trades, quant confidence is very low.

## Caveats
- This is testnet paper execution and does not include full live slippage/latency/psychology effects.
- Small sample windows can strongly overfit recent market regime.
- Projection assumes future trade distribution resembles observed sample.
