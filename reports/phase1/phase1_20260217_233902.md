## $100 Projection (Observed Sample)
- End Equity: $100.0
- Net PnL: $0.0
- Total Return: 0.0%
- Trades/Hour: 0.0

## Monte Carlo Projection (Same Trade Distribution)
- 7D trade count estimate: 0
- 7D P10/P50/P90 on $100: $100.0 / $100.0 / $100.0
- 30D trade count estimate: 0
- 30D P10/P50/P90 on $100: $100.0 / $100.0 / $100.0

## Grades
- Engineering Grade: 85.0/100
- Quant Grade: 30.0/100

## Engineering Notes
- No closed trades recorded, limited execution evidence.

## Quant Notes
- Grade capped at 60 due to small sample (<10 closed trades).
- Non-positive expectancy observed.
- Profit factor below 1.0 indicates weak edge.
- No realized trades, quant confidence is very low.

## Runtime Notes
- None

## Runtime Errors
- None

## Caveats
- This is testnet paper execution and does not include full live slippage/latency/psychology effects.
- Small sample windows can strongly overfit recent market regime.
- Projection assumes future trade distribution resembles observed sample.
