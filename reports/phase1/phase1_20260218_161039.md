## Monte Carlo Projection (Same Trade Distribution)
- 7D trade count estimate: 250
- 7D P10/P50/P90 on $100: $100.0 / $100.0 / $100.0
- 30D trade count estimate: 1073
- 30D P10/P50/P90 on $100: $100.0 / $100.0 / $100.0

## Grades
- Engineering Grade: 100.0/100
- Quant Grade: 34.1/100

## Engineering Notes
- No major runtime reliability issues observed.

## Quant Notes
- Grade capped at 60 due to small sample (<10 closed trades).
- Non-positive expectancy observed.
- Profit factor below 1.0 indicates weak edge.

## Runtime Notes
- Forced cleanup closed 1 open position(s).

## Runtime Errors
- None

## Caveats
- This is testnet paper execution and does not include full live slippage/latency/psychology effects.
- Small sample windows can strongly overfit recent market regime.
- Projection assumes future trade distribution resembles observed sample.
