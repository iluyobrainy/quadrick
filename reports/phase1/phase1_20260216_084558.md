## Runtime Reliability
- Initialized: True
- Fatal Error: None
- Runtime Error Count: 0
- Forced Task Cancelled: True
- Snapshots Collected: 22

## Trading Metrics
- Closed Trades: 1
- Win Rate: 0.0%
- Expectancy: 0.0% per trade
- Profit Factor: 0.0
- Max Drawdown on $100 curve: 0.0%

## $100 Projection (Observed Sample)
- End Equity: $100.0
- Net PnL: $0.0
- Total Return: 0.0%
- Trades/Hour: 5.238505

## Monte Carlo Projection (Same Trade Distribution)
- 7D trade count estimate: 880
- 7D P10/P50/P90 on $100: $100.0 / $100.0 / $100.0
- 30D trade count estimate: 3771
- 30D P10/P50/P90 on $100: $100.0 / $100.0 / $100.0

## Grades
- Engineering Grade: 92.0/100
- Quant Grade: 31.2/100

## Engineering Notes
- Main loop required force-cancel on shutdown.

## Quant Notes
- Grade capped at 60 due to small sample (<10 closed trades).
- Non-positive expectancy observed.
- Profit factor below 1.0 indicates weak edge.

## Runtime Notes
- Main loop task cancelled on timeout.

## Runtime Errors
- None

## Caveats
- This is testnet paper execution and does not include full live slippage/latency/psychology effects.
- Small sample windows can strongly overfit recent market regime.
- Projection assumes future trade distribution resembles observed sample.
